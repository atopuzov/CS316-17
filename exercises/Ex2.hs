-- There will be a test on this exercise in the lab on that date.

-- Your combined score from the submission and the test will be worth
-- 30% of the overall marks for the class (so one mark, below is worth
-- half a percent).
--
-- The test will consists of further requirements issued as updates to
-- this file, and you will need to make changes in response to the new
-- requirements, then commit a new version of the file by the end of
-- the lab session.

{- 2.6 Your mission is to test if a given value is somewhere in a tree
       efficiently, under the assumption that the tree is a /binary

       A tree is a binary search tree if:

       1. it is 'Leaf'; or

          (a) every value in l is <= x
          (b) every value in r is >= x
          (c) l is a binary search tree
          (d) r is a binary search tree

{- This exercise is about modelling processes which input and output
   bits. Processes are things. They're a kind of tree, representing a
   decision process, given by the following datatype. -}

{- We'll do the setup, then it'll be your turn. -}

data Process

  | Output Bool Process

  | Input Process Process
           -- (Input tp fp) inputs a bit, continuing as tp if it's
           -- True, fp if False
  deriving Show

{- Don't expect the data in this type to *do* anything! Rather, they
   *represent* processes. We'll see how to interpret them shortly. -}

{- Let's have an example process: this process should output False if its
   input is True and True if its input is False. -}

notGate :: Process
notGate = Input (Output False End) (Output True End)

{- See? If the input is True, we take the left path and find
   (Output False End), otherwise we go right and find (Output True End).
   Either way, we make one output and then stop. -}

{- How can we make processes go? We need to interpret them. Here's how.
   The "process" function takes a Process to interpret, and a list of input
   bits in [Bool], then produces the list of output bits. -}

process :: Process -> [Bool] -> [Bool]
process End            bs        = []
  -- when we're at the end, there is no more output
process (Output b p)   bs        = b : process p bs
  -- the output from (Output b p) had better begin with b, and the rest
  -- is whatever comes out from running p on the input
process (Input tp fp)  (b : bs)  = process (if b then tp else fp) bs
  -- when the process wants input, the result depends on the first bit
  -- in the input list: if that's True, then we continue with the tp
  -- branch; if it's false, we continue with the fp branch. In both
  -- cases, we feed the rest of the input bs to the continuing process
process (Input tp fp)  []        = []
  -- in the unfortunate case where the process wants input but the input
  -- list is empty, we're a bit stuck; let's stop and return no output

{- Let's try it out. Here are some test examples. Try loading this file

{- 2.10 Ignoring input. You can see there's quite a bit of repetition
   in orGate and andGate. For example, if the first input to orGate
   is True, then the output must be True, irrespective of the second
   input. But we do have to consume the input, even if it makes no
   difference. Write a function... -}

always :: Process -> Process

{- ... which takes a process p and produces the process which reads
   one input, then ignores it and acts like p in *both* cases. -}

{- 1 mark -}

{- You should find that you can simplify your gates. If you've got
   "wire" and "always" right, you should find this new definition
   of orGate works just the same as the old one. -}

orGate' :: Process

{- See? If the first input is True, then the output is always True,

{- 2.15 Sequencing processes. Write a function which combines two processes

sequ :: Process -> Process -> Process

That is, sequencing two notGate components gives you a process which negates
two inputs. -}

{- 3 marks -}


{- 2.16 Pipelining processes. Write a function which combines two processes
   so that the output from the first is used as the input for the second.
   That is, the combined process should keep the inputs from the first
   process and the outputs from the second process, but hide the communication
   in the middle. Give priority to the second process, so the first runs only
   when the second is demanding input. We've done some of it for you, but

   Fix these problems by defining a new function
